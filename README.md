# **RAG-Based-AI-Application-with-Deepseek-R1-1.5B**

## 🚀 **Overview**  
This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application that enables users to **upload PDF and audio files** to extract meaningful information and generate **text and voice-based responses** using the **Deepseek-R1:1.5B** AI model.  
The application is built using **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, and **Ollama**, with additional **reinforcement learning (RLHF)** for continuous improvement.

## 🎯 **Features**

- 📄 **PDF & Audio File Upload** – Process both **text and speech-based inputs**
- 🎙 **Speech-to-Text (STT)** – Convert uploaded **audio files into text**
- 🔍 **Vector Embeddings & Retrieval** – Enables **fast and context-aware search**
- 🤖 **Deepseek-R1:1.5B AI Model** – Generates **intelligent responses**
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** – Outputs responses in both **text and audio**
- 📊 **Reinforcement Learning (RLHF)** – Users can **rate responses as Good/Bad**, improving **model accuracy over time**
- 🖥 **Streamlit UI** – **Interactive and user-friendly interface**

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- **Streamlit** – Web UI framework  
- **LangChain** – For RAG and text processing  
- **Ollama** – Embeddings & LLM integration  
- **Deepseek-R1:1.5B** – AI model for response generation  
- **PDFPlumber** – PDF text extraction  
- **SpeechRecognition** – Convert voice to text  
- **pyttsx3** – Text-to-speech for voice output  
- **InMemoryVectorStore** – Efficient semantic search

## 🏗️ **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository** to your local system.  
2. **Install the required dependencies** to ensure all necessary packages are available.  
3. **Run the application** to start interacting with the RAG system.

## 📌 **Usage Guide**

1. **Upload a PDF or Audio File.**  
2. If uploading an **audio file**, the system will **transcribe it into text**.  
3. The **Deepseek-R1:1.5B AI model** generates an **intelligent response**.  
4. The response is provided in both **text and voice format**.  
5. **Users can rate responses (Good/Bad)** to help improve model performance.

## 🚀 **Future Improvements**

- **Support for additional file formats** like DOCX, TXT, etc.  
- **Multi-language support** for better accessibility  
- **Integration with cloud-based vector databases** for scalability  
- **Real-time voice interaction** for a more conversational AI experience  
- **Voice command support for specially-abled individuals** to enhance accessibility
